## About the author

> Curiosity is my driving force!  


After a master's degree in organic chemistry and nanosciences, my curiosity led me to keep learning about various fields throughout the years. I eventually became passionate about artificial intelligence, and while exploring deeper in this area discovered statistics and data science under a new beautiful light: a perfect fit for someone who allways loved to answer questions from raw data, and share knowledge acquired from my deep dives into very specialized subjects.  
  
Today, I am working through various projects and teaching ressources to become a data scientist.
